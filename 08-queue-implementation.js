// There are many ways to implement a queue. 
// You have learned using singly linked list, and doubly linked list. 
// Keeping the concept of a queue in mind, implement a queue using 2 stacks and no other data structure. 
// (You are not allowed to use a doubly linked list or array. Use your stack implementation with a linked list from above to solve this problem.)
