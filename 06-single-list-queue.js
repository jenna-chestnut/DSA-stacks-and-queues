// Write a Queue class with its core functions (enqueue(), dequeue()) from scratch.

// Create a queue called starTrekQ and add Kirk, Spock, Uhura, Sulu, and Checkov to the queue.
// Implement a peek() function outside of the Queue class that lets you take a peek at what the 1st item in the queue is.
// Implement a isEmpty() function outside the Queue class that allows you to check if the queue is empty or not
// Implement a display() function outside of the Queue class that lets you display what's in the queue.
// Remove Spock from the queue and display the resulting queue.
