// At the Ophidian Bank, a single teller serves a long queue of people. 
// New customers join the end of the queue, and the teller will serve a customer only if they have all of the appropriate paperwork. 
// Write a representation of this queue; 
// 25% of the time (random), a customer's paperwork isn't quite right, and it's back to the end of the queue. 
// Show what a few minutes of the bank's lobby would look like.
